    "# Introduction to the Detector\n",
    "The Detector is a core component of all scanning systems. It is the part recieving X-rays from the beam source, converting them into signals (the images we see).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous setting you quickly looked at defining a detector's spacial location, along with the number and size of pixels the detector will recieve. In this notebook, we will take a further in-depth look into how these paramaters are not enough to accurately simulate real-life detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GVXR, the detector is modelled as a simple 2D plane in the path of the beam source. This virtual detector by default has perfect properties, resulting in a theoretical perfect image. Real life detectors are unfortunately not perfect, and obtaining high quality images relies on more than resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/scene-detector.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a camera, detectors can be built in many different ways. One common detector type uses scintillators to absorb x-rays and re-emit the absorbed energy as light. This light is then detected using transistors to produce an electrical image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/detector-scintillator.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this process isn't perfect! the generated light energy is picked up by neighbouring transistors, causing blurring. Depending on the quality of the detector, this effect can drastically effect the quality of the produced scan. This phenomenon can be measured and used to calibrate detectors. The measured response is called the Line Spread Function.\n"

    "## OTF, MTF, PSF, ESF, and LSF\n",
    "\n",
    "OTF, MTF, PSF, and LSF are all values used to represent the 'spillover' caused by imperfect detectors. Since scintillator detectors are not perfect there is light leakage causing other nearby pixels to be effected. This has a dramatic effect on scans. Although the large number of acronyms can be confusing, we are only interested in LSF and PSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optical Transfer Function (OTF) specifies how the detector system reacts to different spacial frequencies. It describes in the Fourier domain the transform of the Point Spread Function (PSF) applied to an image recieved by the detector. The Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is defined as the magnitude of the OTF and has similar uses in different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "![OTF relationship](img/otf.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific case, we are interested in the Point Spread Fuction (PSF) and Line Spread Function (LSF).\n",
    "The PSF can be seen as the effect a single pixel has on the surrounding pixels, whereas LSF is a single line of this PSF though the origin. As mentioned previously in this notebook, a detector's consutrction is not perfect, and the scintillators commonly used in detectors are picked up by neighbouring pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/detector-scintillator.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSF is used rather than PSF as the measurement can be calculated from an image by using a sharp gradient change, and calculating the Edge Spread Function (ESF). The first derivative of the ESF is the LSF.\n",
    "Although it would be more mathematically correct to use the PSF; this cannot be calculated using experiments, as the original obtained LSF is already been affected by the vertical component of the PSF.\n",
    "This is regarded as generally a non-issue, since the common usage of xCT is to assume slices are independent of each other.\n",
