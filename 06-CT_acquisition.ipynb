    "CT scanners are able to create 3D slices through an object by using multiple X-ray images (also known as projections, or radiographs) taken at various angles around a sample. The full details and terminology of how this reconstruction method works will be covered in tomorrow's training with CIL, for now we will treat it as a black-box function. The quality of projections directly impact the details in the final result, in this session we will take a look at what can effect our scan. *Some of the impacts on getting good scans are not obvious!*"
