The full details and terminology of how this reconstruction method works will be covered in tomorrow's training with CIL, for now we will treat it as a black-box function. The quality of projections directly impact the details in the final result, in this session we will take a look at what can effect our scan. *Some of the impacts on getting good scans are not obvious!*"
