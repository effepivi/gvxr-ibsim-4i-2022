# [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/) user training day at [IBSim-4i](https://ibsim.co.uk/events/ibsim-4i/) 2022

- Session 0 -- Warming up
    - Log in;
    - Copy the training data;
    - Install the Python packages needed for this course;
    - Check that [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/) is working well;
    - Verify which version of [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/) is installed (software and hardware);
    - How to get help (during and after the training)
- Session 1 -- Introduction to X-ray attenuation and its implementation in [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/)
    - Explain what gVXR is and why it has been developed;
    - Introduce projection X-ray imaging and how X-rays are produced;
    - Understand how X-rays interact with matter;
    - Become familiar with the Beer-Lambert law to compute the attenuation of X-rays by matter;
    - Describe how the Beer-Lambert law is implemented in [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/);
    - Compare images simulated using [gVirtualXray](https://gvirtualxray.sourceforge.io/) with ground truth images.
