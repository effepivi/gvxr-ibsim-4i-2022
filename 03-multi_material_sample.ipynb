Here ID is, once again a label for the model, elements is a list of atomic number for all the elements in the mixture (note: names and symbols don't currently work) and amounts are the relative amounts of each element (out of 100%). You will also need to specify the density of the mixture using `gvvxr.setDensity(ID,density,units)` in this case density is a number and units is a string that denote the units used (in this case the only allowed values are `\"g/cm3\"` or `\"g.cm-3\"`).\n",
