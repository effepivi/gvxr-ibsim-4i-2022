    "As you have seen, gVXR provides a strong basis for running x-ray simulations. With the speed provided of GPU acceleration, we are able to quickly produce accurate images.\n",
    "However, X-ray scanners are never perfect, and a large amount of facts influence the final result. We are able to try and paramaterise these scanning artefacts, and with the use of rapid simulations, obtain images closer to the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of artefacts are polychromatic beam spectra, material density, detector energy response, line spread functions, etc. In this session we will take a look at sample positioning as a use case, but the same approach can be used for all methods.\n",
